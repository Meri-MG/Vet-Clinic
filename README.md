# Vet-Clinic

> In this project is used a relational database to create the initial data structure for a vet clinic. There is a table to store animals' information, insert some data into it, and query it.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly.
